## How2Use
An example Excel file is given: [TemperatureDrop_Buried&InsulatedPipeV02_r02.xlsm](https://github.com/DrTol/temperature_drop-Excel/blob/master/TemperatureDrop_Buried%26InsulatedPipeV02_r02.xlsm), which illustrates how to use the VB functions developed i) [Tout](https://github.com/DrTol/temperature_drop-Excel/blob/master/Tout) and ii) [Tout_simple](https://github.com/DrTol/temperature_drop-Excel/blob/master/Tout_simple). 

These functions are based on other VBA functions: 
a) [XSteam](https://github.com/DrTol/temperature_drop-Excel/blob/master/XSteam) for the water properties, 
b) [f_Clamond](https://github.com/DrTol/temperature_drop-Excel/blob/master/f_Clamond) to return the Darcy friction factor,
c) [zOthers](https://github.com/DrTol/temperature_drop-Excel/blob/master/zOthers) involves of VB functions to calculate pi number and Reynolds number
